    "## Introduction to Arithmetic Expression Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic expressions are fundamental in mathematics and programming. They involve basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In this section, we'll explore some common arithmetic expressions to illustrate how they can be used in calculations.\n",

    "1. **Addition**: Combining two or more numbers to find their total.\n",
    "   Example: `2 + 3 = 5`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subtraction**: Finding the difference between two numbers.\n",
    "   Example: `5 - 3 = 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiplication**: Repeated addition of a number.\n",
    "   Example: `2 * 3 = 6`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Division**: Splitting a quantity into equal parts.\n",
    "   Example: `6 / 2 = 3`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Exponentiation**: Raising a number to a power.\n",
    "   Example: `2^3 = 8`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Modulus**: Finding the remainder after division.\n",
    "   Example: `7 % 3 = 1` (because 7 divided by 3 equals 2 with a remainder of 1)\n",
